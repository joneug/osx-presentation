I am happy to announce the release of Présentation.app 3.3.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Présentation.app is a presentation tool for pdf slides (e.g. produced using LaTeX and the popular beamer class) for Mac OS X.
You can download this release here: http://iihm.imag.fr/blanch/software/osx-presentation/releases/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3 announce

The biggest code change introduced by this release consists in allowing to play the movies directly embedded in the slide.
Additionally, the inset live video can now be moved to any corner of the presentation view.

This release also adds some minor features/fixes (see detailed list of changes below), the most notable being a fix for bugs in the help text layout introduced by Apple's upgrade of TextKit, and a more consistant way to handle deletion of onscreen annotations for multi-frame pages.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2 announce

The biggest code change introduced by this release consists in switching from hand-crafted parsing of javascript code produced by the LaTeX animate package to using the JavaScriptCore framework for that task.
This allows to improve the support for animations: loop and autoplay should now be supported.

This release also adds some minor features/fixes (see below), the most notable being that links to youtube video are redirected to invidious when opened in the webview for a cleaner web interface (can be deactivated with the --youtube switch).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1.1 announce

This minor release adds support for python3.9 which is the default Python interpreter for macos 12.6.
It also adds support for python3.7 for late user of macos 12.4.
The PyObjC binaries are now (for 12.6+) universal (x86_64 and arm64).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 announce

This release adds many new features, most notably centered about embeded media support:

- support for movies embeded in PDF annotations;
- support for animation generated by the popular animate LaTeX package.

Other new features useful when presenting remotely:

- the presentation window can be made fullscreen with the presenter window remaining windowed (double click in presentation window);
- added a "laser" pointer in addition to the highlighting cursor;


The app is signed since 3.0, the installer is now notarized and stapled, so that it's easier to install.

This is only possible by buying a membership to the apple developer program, at the cost of 99 USD a year.
In order to cover this expense, I have setup a buymeacoffee page where any user can contribute a small amount:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.0 announce

This release is a major code overhaul following python2 support being dropped by Apple with Monterey.

The code has been Python 2/3 compatible for a long time, but relied on python2 and the PyObjC bindings provided by Apple (which had a lot of shortcommings to be worked around).
Switching to python3/recent PyObjC allowed for a major code clean-up, but at a cost: the PyObjC bindings are now embedded in the app and the app size is more than hundred times bigger (from 113kB to 15.5MB).

This release also includes many small fixes and improvements, see below for a list.

The app is also now signed which makes it possible again to access the video camera and easier to install.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Présentation most notable features are:

+ support for distant presentation/teaching
  - inset of live video from the presenter
  - white board and support for pen interaction
  - support for more than 2 screens setups
  - "spotlight", laser and large cursor mode on presentation screen

+ a presenter view displaying
  - the current and next slide
  - a timer
  - the notes associated to the current slide

+ hyperlinks do work
  - internal links (e.g. navigation links generated by beamer) work
  - links to local video files open the video on the presentation screen
  - links to other files are opened in a webview on the presentation screen

+ usable
  - from the command line (as it is a Python script)
  - from the Finder (as it accepts dropping a PDF file to launch the app)
